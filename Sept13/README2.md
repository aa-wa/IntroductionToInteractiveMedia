When the first project failed I felt like I wanted to restart and do a simpler program. I was also feeling inspired by the oher student's projects. So for this one, I just experimented with creating the for loop and making sure it work because it hadn't in the last project. After that, I experiment with different numbers, and then I got the idea of using the variable from the for loop for the shapes I was making. I felt like the artwork was too simplistic and I wanted to experiment more, so I then added the element of the Perlin Noise to see how it would change the movement of the art and I liked how it looked because it felt much smoother. 

This project felt way more easy to handle and execute than the first one. This taught me that perhaps sometimes it is better to let the code guide you than running after a vision. I do want to learn how to execute the first vision I had at some point though.
