**November 4 Assignment Updates**

So far, I've been really enjoying Arduino so I was very excited for the project. I started off by making a circuit with a normal switch to ensure that all the components were set up in the right place. I did this while I was on call with a friend, so he got to witness how to make a circuit and helped me debug when something did not work. 

I had an issue with the switch not working even though everything was in the right placed, and I checked several times. I was using the DigitalReadSerial example from Arduino to see if my switch was working and it kept showing zeros even when the switch was pressed. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my circuit, so I built it again and it still did not work. Then I realized I hadn't changed the pushbutton code in Arduino and my wires were connected to a differnt input. My circuit was never wrong, I was just using the wrong code! After I fixed that, I changed and played around until I found a pattern that I liked for my LED lights and it looked like this:

Now that the circuit was running, I wanted to create the switch that worked without my hands. I had been thinking about this while I made the circuit and want to explore using utensils because it was the most reading available objects and because I thought it'd be fun. My idea was to have a spoon hanging from the door handle and when the door swung into place the spoon would come in contact with the wires and complete the circuit. 

I first tried to see if the circuit work with the spoon before hanging it on the door. And it did! Here is a picture while the whole project was still on the desk:

After setting up my design, I realized that the wires were so delicate to stand on their own so I made a small "holder" for them out of cardboard that I was going to recycle.

Unfortunately, the swinging of the spoon was too violent and too much of movement for the wires to catch the current for a continuous moment and let the LED lights run. The spoon did touch the wires but not the tips at all times. Instead, I adjusted the wires to be above and below one another, rather than side by sad, and instead of having the spoon swing from the door, I stuck it to the door. This reduced of a lot of movement.

And then, my project of a handless switch was complete! (I absolutely moved the door using my feet)
