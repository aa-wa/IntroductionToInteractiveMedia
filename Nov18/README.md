**November 18 Assignment Updates**

Ever since I decided I am going back home and staying there for a bit after graduationg, I've been thinking about how it will be. I haven't been home in a while and I've gotten used to how peaceful Abu Dhabi is. One of the things I worry or think about a lot is Kathmandu's soundscape. Kathmandu is loud and chaotic, one of the sounds I deeply resonate with as "hom" is the chaos you hear when entering a temple. There are bells tolling everywhere, pidgeons scattering, dogs running after them and a lot of random chanting. I wanted to see if I could recreate some of those chaotic sounds for this week's project. 


I started with connected a small bell I had to the servo with thread and one of the spinning attachements. I tried with serveral attachements until I found one that actually made the bell ring when I ran my program, which was similar to the example we worked with in class. 

This is my bell:

Then, I wanted to recreate the chanting. I knew I coulnd't get it to sound exactly like that, but I thought I could recreate the type of chant where someone is essentially screming at differnt pitches, so not neccesarily saying words but going like "AAAaaaaAAAaaaaaaaaAaaaa". If I could control the pitch of the sound that was coming out and frequently change it, it could sound like someone who is doing that. Initially I thought of the pentiometer but I didn't want the sound to just go higher and smaller, I wanted it to have more variation, so instead I used a light sensor and connected it to the speaker. 

Together, the bells and the chanting sounded very chaotic, it wasn't exactly what a temple sounds like, but it really parelleled the chaos of it. The sound of the servo motor was quite loud though, and it added a lto fo background noise to the bell and chanting. If I had access to a bigger bell, that would've probably solved the problem but for now, I thnk it hads to the chaos. I imagine it to be all the cars in nearby streets humming past. I added a switch to the bell so that I could control it, almost like one person ringing the bells then entering the temple, then the bells ringing again when the next person enters and so on... 

I didn't have much trouble with the code for this one, but I think the confusion, and a lot of trial and error came in trying to figure out where and how to build the bell and what worked best for recreating the chants. 

This is what the final project looked and sounded like:
