**Sept 30 Assignment Updates **

I wanted to try to do the data visualization project because I wanted to see if I cold challenge myself. 

As someone who struggles a lot with mental health, I wanted to use a dataset regarding mental health in Nepal because it is avery negleced area of research and resources. Unsurprisingly, there were no datasets available. I looked online and found a dataset on depressive episodes in the US. 

When I tried first importing the file, I simply copy pasted the names from the folders it was kept in to my code. 

```
 strings = loadStrings("Users/macbookair/Desktop/samhsa-major-depressive-episode/data/2012_2014_substate_sae_table_27.csv");
```
I knew there were no mistakes in the names but processing kept saying the it couldn't load the file. I couldnt figure out why. I renamed the file to a single word and shifted it to the desktop and it loaded then. I don't understand why it didn't work with the longer name given that it was the same code.
