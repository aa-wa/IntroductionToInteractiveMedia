# Final Project Concept

I want to continue with my Tic-Tac-Toe that I built for my Mid-Term. However, I want to make it so that the turning of the potentiometer selects the box in which the 'Tic-Tac' or the 'Toe' is to be placed and blocking light from the LDR places the 'Tic-Tac' or the 'Toe'. And, every time a Tic-Tac is placed, a blue LED glows for some time and every time a Toe is placed, a yellow LED glows for some time. Similarly, in case anyone wins, a Green LED glows, a blue led (if Tic-Tac wins) or a yellow LED (if Toe wins) blinks, and a victory sound effect is played through the Buzzer. In case of a draw, a red LED fades in and out.
