**Sept 7 Assignment Updates**

This was such a fun process! It was difficult and very time consuming, but I enjoyed the creativity and satisfaction of being able to write my own code so much!! 

Here is my Self Portrait:

I tried uploading it using the code we learned for images but I couldn't figure out a code for videos. Instead Googling told me that I could do it by dragging the file but unfortunately that only shows a link to the video and not the actual video. My apologies for this!

Similarly, of my frustration in this process came from merely figuring out how to share my code and portrait once I had made it. The portrait was a video, I could not simply take a screenshot, instead I had to learn how to attach/upload video files to Github and Discord. I also faced problems with the screen recording of the portrait itself. Since the background's color changing effect lasts for only a few seconds, I had to start the recording immediately after I ran the code but the application I was using to record had unnecceary gimmicks that made me press/drag multiple buttons before I could select the particular portion of the screen I wanted to record. At this moment, I wwondered if there was any command on Processing that could delay the code or allow me to "press enter to start" the dynamic part after having run the program on Processing. That would have helped a lot! 

Difficulties with coding: 

1. When I started my self portrait, I had a specific image in mind. I wanted the background to be a rainbow of colors, constantly changing, with my features haphazardly spread out. So the first task I tried was randomizing the color for the background. However, because I wanted a gradient effect, I experimented with the code to change the integers I set with minimum increaments. At first, I put all the RGB values and then the RGB Values +1. This created the gradient, but it went from white to black. Instead, I added R+1, G(random value) and B-1 which helped create the gradient in colors. In order to loop the changes, and make the R and B values begin again when they reached 255 or 0, respectively, I tried using the if statement we used in class. However, the code did not work and made the background static. I tried multiple combinations of values but every combination led to the background being one color, randomised each time. In the end I chose to leave the code without the loop, so that the background could still be dynamic even if for the first few seconds only. 
2. When I moved on to making the features of my face, I had a rather weird trouble. I was trying to make shapes after having made my eyes on top of the background but nothing was showing up. I tried multiple shapes, removing codes for the eyes or the background with the // syntax to see if the shapes were just overlapping, but nothing was showing up. It was rather confusing because the codes did not show any syntax error and run perfectly. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I kept experimenting with different fill/stroke codes thinking that could be the issue. Later on, I copy pasted a code for circles from my class notes and that somehow showed up. I checked with my earlier codes and they were the same. Both were within the size and both followed the syntax. I'm not sure what went wrong, but after that all the shapes I made showed up and I continued wih my portrait. 

In conclusion, I had two major issues with coding, both of which I could not resolve or necessarily understood, but I was still able to make my portrait the way I envisioned it and it was such a rewarding process!!
